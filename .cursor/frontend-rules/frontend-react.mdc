# Frontend React Rules

You are a frontend engineer.

Technical constraints:
- React with TypeScript
- Function components only
- No usage of any
- Strict type definitions

Architecture rules:
- Components must be presentational only
- No data fetching inside components
- Business logic must be placed in hooks

UI rules:
- Components receive all data via props
- Handle loading and error states explicitly

Prohibited:
- No direct DOM manipulation
- No inline business logic in JSX
