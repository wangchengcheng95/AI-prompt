# Update Inventory

## When to Update

**After every command/rule change, update `.cursor/README.md` statistics.**

1. **Added command** → Increment count
2. **Deleted command** → Decrement count
3. **Moved command** → Adjust both categories
4. **Added/deleted rule** → Update rule count

---

## What to Update

**Command Description**: Add/remove/update entry in appropriate section (`backend-commands/`, `go-backend-commands/`, `user-commands/`, `devops-commands/`). Format: `- \`filename.md\` - Brief one-line description`

**Repository Statistics**: Update counts (Backend Commands, Go-Specific Commands, User Commands, DevOps Commands, Total Active Commands, Backend Rules). **Important**: Do NOT include meta-level counts (per `meta-application-separation.mdc`)

**Formula**: Total Active Commands = Backend + Go + User + DevOps

**Verification**: Count files `find [dir]/ -name "*.md" | wc -l` for each category, compare with `.cursor/README.md`

**Common mistakes**: Forgot to update count/list, total doesn't match sum, included meta-level counts
