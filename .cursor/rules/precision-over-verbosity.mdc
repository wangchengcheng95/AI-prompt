# Precision Over Verbosity

## Rules

**Every word must earn its place.** Concise, actionable instructions > lengthy explanations.

**1. Commands**: Action-oriented - focus on WHAT and HOW, not WHY

**2. Overviews**: 2-4 sentences maximum

**3. Steps**: Direct and specific - show code/commands immediately, not explanations first

**4. Documentation**: Delete redundancy - check overlap (`grep -r "keyword" docs/`), if >60% delete/consolidate, delete process files after completion

**5. Examples**: Show, don't explain - code example directly, no preamble

**6. Comments**: Explain "Why", not "What"

## Enforcement

**Creating content**: Write first draft, cut 30%, ask "Does each sentence add value?", replace explanations with examples

**Reviewing content**: Flag paragraphs >5 sentences, flag docs with >60% overlap, delete process files after completion

**Red flags**: Paragraphs >5 sentences, overviews >4 sentences, multiple docs on same topic (>60% overlap), explanations before examples, hedging

**Anti-patterns**: ❌ Unnecessary politeness, hedging, redundant modifiers, passive voice | ✅ Direct, confident, precise, active voice
