# Check Before Create

## Rules

**Before creating ANY new command or rule**, perform similarity checks:
- **Commands**: Use `check-similar-commands.md`, search keywords, check filenames, read candidates
- **Rules**: Grep for rule topic across `*-rules/`, check purpose, assess overlap

**Similarity thresholds**:
- **High (80-100%)**: ❌ REJECT, use existing
- **Medium (50-80%)**: ❌ REJECT, extend existing
- **Low (20-50%)**: ⚠️ Consider, create with differentiation if distinct
- **None (0-20%)**: ✅ Proceed

**Search strategies**: Keyword search, filename patterns, content analysis (compare Overview, check Steps overlap)

## Enforcement

**Before creating**: Search similar content, read candidates, assess overlap

**Decision**: High/medium similarity → REJECT, reference/extend existing. Low/no similarity → Proceed with differentiation.

**Key principle**: Default to NO. When in doubt, don't create. Prefer extending existing content. Quality over quantity.
