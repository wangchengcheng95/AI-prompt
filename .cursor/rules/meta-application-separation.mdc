description: Maintain separation between meta-level (repository management) and application-level (backend development)

# Meta-Application Separation

## Rules

**Application-level** (backend development in other projects):
- `backend-commands/`, `go-backend-commands/`, `user-commands/`, `devops-commands/`, `go-backend-rules/`, `docs/` - Committed to git, distributed, public
- Users: Backend developers

**Never mix levels**: Meta in `.cursor/`, Application in other directories

**Decision rule**: Ask "What is this for?" - "Managing THIS repository" → Meta, "Using in backend projects" → Application

**Naming**: Meta references "this repository", Application references "projects" or domains

## Documentation Placement

**Application-level docs** (`.cursor/README.md`, `README.md`, `docs/*`):
- ✅ Document: Backend development commands/rules, usage guide, command classification
- ❌ Do NOT document: Meta-commands/rules, repository management tools, internal processes
- **Rationale**: Application-level docs are distributed. Meta-level is internal.

**Repository statistics** (in `.cursor/README.md`):
- ✅ Include: Backend Commands, User Commands, Total Active Commands, application-level rules count
- ❌ Exclude: Meta-Rules count, Meta-Commands count

## Enforcement Actions

**When creating files**: Determine level (managing repo? → `.cursor/`, backend development? → application directories), never mix

**When updating documentation**: Scan for meta-level content in `.cursor/README.md` or `README.md`, remove if found, keep application-level only

**When user asks to document meta-content**: "Meta-level content (`.cursor/commands/`, `.cursor/rules/`) is for managing this repository and should not be documented in `.cursor/README.md` or `README.md`. These files are application-level docs distributed with the command collection. Meta-level content is internal and excluded from version control."

**Key**: `.cursor/README.md` is application-level despite being in `.cursor/`
