# Simplify Documentation

## Overview

Remove redundancy, consolidate information, and improve clarity while preserving all critical content. Make documentation more concise without losing essential information.

## Steps

1. **Analyze document structure**
   - Read the entire document to understand purpose and scope
   - Identify main sections and their relationships
   - Note repetitive content or overlapping information
   - Understand target audience and use cases

2. **Identify redundancy**
   - Find repeated explanations of the same concepts
   - Locate duplicate examples or code snippets
   - Identify verbose descriptions that can be condensed
   - Spot unnecessary background information

3. **Consolidate information**
   - Merge similar sections covering the same topic
   - Combine related examples into single comprehensive examples
   - Unify scattered information about the same concept
   - Keep the clearest explanation, remove redundant ones

4. **Simplify language**
   - Replace verbose phrases with concise alternatives
   - Remove filler words and unnecessary qualifiers
   - Use active voice instead of passive voice
   - Convert long sentences into shorter, clearer ones
   - Replace complex terminology with simpler alternatives when possible

5. **Optimize structure**
   - Reorganize sections for better flow and logical grouping
   - Use bullet points or tables instead of long paragraphs where appropriate
   - Create clear hierarchies with proper headings
   - Move detailed information to appendices if not essential

6. **Preserve and verify**
   - Ensure all critical information is retained
   - Keep necessary examples (make them concise)
   - Maintain important warnings, notes, and best practices
   - Verify the simplified version is complete and accurate
   - Confirm readability and clarity are improved

## Rules

- **Preserve accuracy**: Never remove or alter critical information, facts, or technical details
- **Maintain completeness**: All essential concepts, examples, and instructions must remain
- **Improve clarity**: Simplification should make the document easier to understand
- **Keep structure**: Maintain logical organization and clear navigation
- **Respect context**: Consider the document's purpose and audience when simplifying

## Simplification Techniques

- **Remove redundancy**: Delete repeated explanations, duplicate examples, overlapping content
- **Consolidate**: Merge similar sections, combine related examples, unify scattered information
- **Condense**: Replace verbose descriptions with concise alternatives, use shorter sentences
- **Reorganize**: Improve structure and flow, group related information together
- **Use formats**: Convert long paragraphs to lists, tables, or diagrams where appropriate
- **Simplify language**: Use plain language, active voice, and direct statements

## Content Guidelines

**Keep:**
- Critical technical information and specifications
- Essential examples and use cases
- Important warnings, notes, and best practices
- Code examples (simplified if verbose)
- Step-by-step instructions
- Configuration details and parameters
- Error handling and troubleshooting information

**Remove:**
- Redundant explanations of the same concept
- Duplicate examples or code snippets
- Unnecessary background information or context
- Verbose descriptions that don't add value
- Filler words and unnecessary qualifiers
- Overly detailed explanations that can be summarized

## Output Format

Provide simplified documentation with:
- Clear section headings and structure
- Concise but complete content
- Improved readability and flow
- All essential information preserved
- Markdown formatting maintained
