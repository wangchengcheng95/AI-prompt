# Design Phase

---

**Design only. Do not write code.**

## Instructions

Analyze the requirements and produce a design that addresses:

### 1. Invariants
- List all system invariants that must hold true at all times
- Define data consistency requirements
- Specify state constraints

### 2. Write Operation Boundaries
- Define the scope and limits of each write operation
- Identify transaction boundaries
- Specify isolation requirements

### 3. Failure Modes
- Enumerate all possible failure scenarios
- Consider: network failures, timeouts, crashes, data corruption
- Define expected behavior for each failure mode
- Identify recovery mechanisms

### 4. API/Interface Design
- Define clear interfaces between components
- Specify input validation rules
- Document expected outputs and error cases

## Output Format

Present the design in structured sections covering invariants, boundaries, failure modes, and interfaces. Be explicit about assumptions and constraints.
