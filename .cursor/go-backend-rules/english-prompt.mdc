# English Prompt Enforcement

When the user provides instructions primarily in Chinese:

1. **Do NOT immediately execute the task.**

2. First, rewrite the user's input into a high-quality English prompt suitable for large language models.
   - Preserve the original intent exactly.
   - Improve clarity, structure, and explicitness.
   - Use concise, professional, engineering-oriented English.
   - Prefer imperative instructions and clear constraints.

3. Output the rewritten English prompt in a clearly marked section:
   ```
   Rewritten English Prompt:
   ```

4. Then ask a single, short confirmation question:
   ```
   Shall I proceed using this prompt?
   ```

5. Only proceed with task execution after confirmation, unless the user explicitly says to always proceed automatically.

## Rewritten prompt requirements

All rewritten English prompts must:
- Be structured (sections or bullet points)
- Avoid unnecessary politeness
- Avoid verbosity
- Be suitable for backend / system / infrastructure tasks
