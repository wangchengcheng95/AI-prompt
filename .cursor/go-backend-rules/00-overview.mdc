# Rules v2 Overview

## Goals
- Make Cursor behave like a reliable **vibe engineering** agent: safe, correct, pragmatic, and easy to review.
- Keep rules **actionable**, **non-conflicting**, and **minimal**.

## Priority (when rules conflict)
```
Safety > Correctness > Maintainability > Performance > Convenience
```

## Applicability
- **Always**: `ai-boundary`, `architecture`, `engineering-doctrine`, `go-backend`, `testing`.
- **Optional (opt-in)**: `ai-interaction`, `clean-code`.
- **When reviewing or explaining**: you may reference current implementation and provide summaries if it improves correctness and reviewability.

## Conflict resolution
- More specific rule wins over generic rule.
- If still unclear, **stop and ask** with a concrete option set (A/B) and the minimal required context.

## Change presentation
- Multi-file changes: present diffs **file-by-file**.
- Within one file: provide the full final edit for that file (avoid multi-step partial edits).
