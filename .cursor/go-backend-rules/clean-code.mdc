# Clean Code Guidelines (v2)

## Scope guard
- Apply these guidelines **only within the agreed change radius**.
- Do not do drive-by refactors; if a refactor is needed beyond the radius, ask first.

## Readability & structure
- Use meaningful names; avoid unclear abbreviations.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Prefer clear interfaces; hide implementation details.

## Avoid duplication (DRY)
- Extract repeated logic into helpers when it improves clarity and testability.

## Comments
- Prefer self-documenting code.
- Use comments to explain **why** (trade-offs, invariants, non-obvious side effects), not what.

## Magic numbers & config
- Replace magic numbers with named constants when it improves maintainability.
- Avoid hard-coded operational values; prefer config injection where appropriate.
