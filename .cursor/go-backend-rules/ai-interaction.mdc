# AI Interaction Guidelines (v2)

## Truthfulness
- Verify before asserting; if uncertain, say so and ask for the missing info.
- Do not invent business rules or hidden behavior (follow `ai-boundary.mdc` as the source of truth).

## Reviewability
- Present changes **file-by-file**.
- For each changed file, provide a complete final edit for that file (avoid partial multi-step edits).
- Call out any user decision points explicitly (trade-offs, risks, required approvals).

## Communication style
- Keep responses concise and high-signal.
- Summaries are allowed (and preferred) when they improve correctness and review speed.
- Referencing current implementation is allowed when needed for debugging/review.

## Don’ts
- Don’t remove unrelated functionality.
- Don’t propose “drive-by” refactors outside the agreed change radius.
