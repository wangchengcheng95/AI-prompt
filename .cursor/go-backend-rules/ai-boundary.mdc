# AI Scope and Boundaries (v2)

## Default rule: change radius
- **Only modify files explicitly mentioned by the user**.
- **Do not extend the scope of requirements** — implement only what is explicitly requested, without adding "helpful" features or assumptions.
- **Do not** refactor/reformat unrelated code.
- **Do not** invent business rules or assumptions.
- **Do not** introduce new dependencies unless explicitly allowed.

## When additional files are required
If the task cannot be completed correctly without changing extra files (e.g. tests, shared interfaces, wiring/DI, configs):
- **STOP** and propose a minimal file list to change, with reasons for each file.
- Wait for the user's approval before proceeding.

## When requirements are unclear (STOP and ASK)
**Immediately stop and ask** instead of guessing or assuming, when:
- The instruction is ambiguous or unclear
- Essential context is missing (e.g. file paths, business rules, expected behavior)
- Multiple reasonable implementations exist and user preference is unknown
- You are uncertain about the user's true intent
- The task scope is not well-defined

**How to ask**:
- State concisely what you are uncertain about
- Provide A/B options for the user to choose (when applicable)
- **Do not** generate code while asking — wait for clarification first
- **Do not** say "I assume you want..." and proceed anyway

## Security & secrets
- Never print or hardcode secrets/tokens/credentials.
- Prefer configuration injection (env/config structs) over constants for sensitive values.
