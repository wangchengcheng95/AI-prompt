# Project Architecture Rules (v2)

This is a business-oriented application.

Architecture principles:
- Clear separation of layers
- No cross-layer access
- Dependencies must point inward

Backend layers:
- handler: HTTP / transport layer only
- service: business logic
- repository: data access

Frontend layers:
- pages: route-level components
- components: pure UI, no business logic
- hooks: business logic and data orchestration

Rules:
- Business logic must not be in handlers or UI components
- IO code must not contain business rules
